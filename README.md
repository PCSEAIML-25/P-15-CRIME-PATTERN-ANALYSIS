ELIGIBILITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT :
A Predictive Approach
 
Vision:
The vision of this project is to empower individuals professional mental healthcare treatment. We aim to achieve this by understanding the factors influencing their decisions and addressing the hurdles that prevent them from seeking necessary mental care treatment. The project also intends to build a predictive analysis model that profiles individuals and determines their likelihood of accepting mental healthcare treatment from a professional. Ultimately, the project seeks to increase the uptake of mental healthcare services among those who require them.
 

Problem Statement:
Despite growing awareness of mental health issues and available resources, there exists a significant gap between those who may benefit from professional mental healthcare and those who actually seek it. The project aims to understand the factors influencing an individual's decision to seek mental health treatment, address the hurdles, and increase the uptake of professional mental care services.

Project Objectives:


Predictive Analysis Model:
1.Train, build, and deploy a predictive model that profiles individuals based on various inputs.
2.Determine an individual's likelihood of accepting mental healthcare treatment from a professional based on the model's prediction results.
 
Scope: In-Scope:
•Data collection and preprocessing.
•Exploratory data analysis to identify influential factors and hurdles.
•Development and evaluation of a predictive analysis model.
Out-of-Scope:
•Direct provision of mental healthcare services. •Detailed medical or clinical diagnosis. •Emergency mental health interventions.
 
Project Deliverables: 1.Predictive Analysis Model:
1.Model code and documentation. 2.Model evaluation report.
3.Deployment of the model in a user-friendly interface (e.g., a web application).
2.Root Cause Analysis Report:
1.In-depth investigation of identified hurdles.
 
Project Risks:
• Privacy Concerns: When collecting data related to mental health, there can be privacy concerns. Individuals may be hesitant to participate in surveys or interviews due to fears of their personal information being mishandled or disclosed.
• Stigma and Social Taboos: Mental health issues are often stigmatized in many societies. People might be reluctant to openly discuss or seek help for fear of social judgment.
• Response Bias: Some participants may provide responses that are socially desirable rather than truthful. This can skew the data and affect the accuracy of the results.
• Data Quality: Inaccurate or incomplete data can compromise the validity of the study. It's essential to ensure that the collected data is reliable.
